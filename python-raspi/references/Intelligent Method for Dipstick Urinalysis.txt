Abstract:
- Framework for color acquisition using a smartphone camera
- Covers: color management system, color correction, color matching, quantification
- Color space: RGB and CIELAB
- An automated color constancy approach is introduced to provide a better color correction
- A step-wise linear interpolation is introduced to better estimate the urinalysis value
- summary: color constancy --> step-wise linear interpolation
